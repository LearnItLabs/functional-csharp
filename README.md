# Advanced C#: Functional Programming Patterns
### Explore functional patterns in C#
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course *Advanced C#: Functional Programming Patterns*. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

### Description
Functional programming offers developers a straightforward way to tackle modern software problems like massive scale, distributed systems, and multiple threaded runtimes. Microsoft created the F# functional language to address this problem space and along the way they also introduced many FP features to C#. 

Curious about how to work functional programming patterns into your .NET applications? In this course, Walt Ritscher shows you how. Discover how to leverage the functional programming features in C# to transform your code. Walt covers key topics such as immutability, higher-order functions, and why expressions are better for functional programs. Plus, learn how to compose function flow in C# using pipelining; work with functional programming concepts like map, filter and bind in LINQ; and more.

## Instructions
This repository contains example code for most of the videos in the course, organized into branches.

You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and view the code at that stage of the course. Alternatively, you can directly access a specific branch by adding `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL.
## Branches in Visual Studio
While following along with the course, you can use Visual Studio's Git tools to switch between branches. This allows you to easily move to the relevant chapter and topic as you progress through the course. 

## Branch Names
The branches are structured to correspond to the chapters in the course. Each branch is named using the format `Chapter#-Topic-Name`. For example, the branch named `02-Avoid-SideEffects` corresponds to the second chapter of the course, which includes a video on avoiding side effects in functional programming. 

To determine which branch to open, refer to the popup displayed at the start of each video.


## Installing
